      <dd>
        Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground
        chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned
        with a sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a
        classic dish in Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a
        popular street food

      <dd>
        Oyakodon is a delicious traditional Japanese meal consisting of chicken
        saut√©ed and then cooked in a Japanese broth, and then finished with egg
        and served over rice. It's really easy, filling, and delicious.

      <dd>
        Bulgogi, or Korean barbecued beef, is made with marinated sliced beef.
        Most recipes call for crushed pear to tenderize the meat. My boyfriend's
        Korean mother says Coca-Cola can also be used for the same purpose. This
        recipe uses very thinly-sliced sirloin steak, so tenderization isn't
        necessary. It's delicious served with rice, lettuce leaves, and chile
        paste or kimchi.
