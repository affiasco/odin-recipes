    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Oyakodon is a delicious traditional Japanese meal consisting of chicken
      sautéed and then cooked in a Japanese broth, and then finished with egg
      and served over rice. It's really easy, filling, and delicious.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>1 onion, cut in half and sliced</li>
      <li>2 cups dashi stock, made with dashi powder</li>
      <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>4 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until
        beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until
        onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in stock, then whisk in soy sauce, mirin, and brown sugar; stir
        until sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until
        slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs in a bowl until well-beaten, then pour into the hot stock
        mixture. Cover the skillet, reduce the heat, and steam until egg is
        cooked, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide rice among 4 deep soup bowls and top with equal amounts of the
        soup mixture.
      </li>
    </ol>
